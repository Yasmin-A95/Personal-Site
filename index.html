    <h1>About</h1>

       <p>
          I'm a newborn programmer learning to run before I can walk at General Assembly, you can count on me to be dedicated and ridiculously keen to learn as much as I can as quickly as I can! 
      </p>
       <p>
          I come from a background in arts having spent two years prior to General Assembly as a photographer. It was during those two years that I was running my own business, plus another five years prior taking pictures as a hobby/side hustle while working a day job at Coles.
       </p>
       <p>
          Never being short of interest in learning new things I was inspired to take to programming when I had an idea for an app I wanted to make:
          Knowing my own tendency to dream big I wanted to make an app that would help keep me organised. I needed a way to break my ambitious artsy projects into the smallest steps I could take, then displaying <em>only</em> that next step to me. 
          This led me to picking the brains of my programmer friend who eventually recommended G.A. when I told her I wanted to program full-time!
        </p>  
       <p> 
          I love getting to use technology to solve problems and express myself creatively. If you're interested in having an eager and creative Junior Web Dev on your team I'm keen to hear from you!
